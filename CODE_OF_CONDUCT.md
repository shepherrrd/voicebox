# VoiceBox Project Code of Conduct

## Purpose

A primary goal of VoiceBox is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Open Communication

We encourage participants to resolve conflicts and misunderstandings by addressing the issues directly and respectfully. If you are not comfortable addressing the issue directly or if the issue persists, please contact the project maintainer, Samuel Ikaba, at [ikabolo59@gmail.com].

## Expected Behavior

- Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your words and actions, and strive to create a positive and inclusive community.
- Exercise empathy and kindness toward other community members.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community:

- Any form of discrimination, including but not limited to gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion.
- Harassment, intimidation, or bullying of any kind.
- Offensive, derogatory, or discriminatory comments.
- Disrespectful or disruptive comments or actions.
- Any form of unwelcome advances, both online and offline.
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated within the VoiceBox community. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainer may take any action they deem appropriate, including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community, without warning.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact the project maintainer, Samuel Abolo, at [ikabolo59@gmail.com]. All reports will be kept confidential.

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project maintainer with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.
